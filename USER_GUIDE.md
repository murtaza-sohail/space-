**Note:** CloudVault uses **Account-Specific Syncing**.
- **Guest State:** When unlinked, your data is stored in your local guest profile.
- **Linked State:** When you link a Google account, CloudVault switches to that account's specific cloud storage. Data you create while logged in is permanently tethered to that email.
- **Auto-Unlinking:** Signing out "unlinks" your session, safely storing your cloud data and restoring your local guest view. Log back in at any time to instantly restore your cloud files!
